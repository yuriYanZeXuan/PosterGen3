You are editing an image to become a clean cartoon icon for use as a subtle poster background decoration.

Goals:
- Convert the icon into a flatter, more "cartoon sticker" style.
- Remove any background and keep ONLY the main icon subject.
- No text, no watermarks, no busy patterns.
- Keep the icon centered with padding and a clear silhouette.
- Use theme color {{ theme_color }} as the primary accent (do not oversaturate).

Return ONLY the edit instruction prompt text (no JSON, no extra commentary).
