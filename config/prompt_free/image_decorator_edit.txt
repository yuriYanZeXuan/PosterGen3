You are editing an image into a clean 2×2 FOUR-PANEL cartoon sheet suitable for splitting into 4 independent quadrant images.

Hard requirements:
- Preserve a clear 2×2 panel layout with strong gutters / dividers.
- Each panel must contain an independent cartoon icon scene; nothing crosses panel boundaries.
- Remove any background outside the icons and frames; output should be easy to background-remove (clean silhouettes).
- No text, no numbers, no captions, no watermarks.
- Use theme color {{ theme_color }} and theme character {{ theme_character }} consistently (not oversaturated).

Return ONLY the edit instruction prompt text (no JSON, no extra commentary).
