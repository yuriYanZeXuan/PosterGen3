You are editing a poster background framework image to make it perfect as a subtle full-slide background for an academic poster.

Goals:
- Keep the overall window/frame/panel outline structure, but reduce visual dominance.
- Make lines thinner and lighter; low-contrast, elegant, minimal.
- Ensure the background is EASY to remove: use a plain solid background behind the frame lines so background removal yields a transparent background with only the frame/outline remaining.
- No text, no logos, no watermarks.
- Preserve the aspect ratio and large whitespace areas.
- Harmonize with theme color {{ theme_color }} and theme character {{ theme_character }}.

Return ONLY the edit instruction prompt text (no JSON, no extra commentary).
