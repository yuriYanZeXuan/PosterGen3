Generate a TRUE 2×2 FOUR-PANEL CARTOON sheet (comic-style), where each panel is an independent icon scene.

Global style:
- Flat/modern cartoon icon, clean edges, minimal details, high readability.
- No text, no numbers, no captions, no watermarks, no logos.
- Strong separation between panels: clear gutters / white dividers / rounded window frames.
- Harmonize with theme color {{ theme_color }} and theme character {{ theme_character }}.

Panel mapping (must be visually independent):
- Top-left panel: {{ panel_1_title }} (icon scene relevant to this title)
- Top-right panel: {{ panel_2_title }} (icon scene relevant to this title)
- Bottom-left panel: {{ panel_3_title }} (icon scene relevant to this title)
- Bottom-right panel: {{ panel_4_title }} (icon scene relevant to this title)

Requirements:
- Style: flat/modern cartoon icon, simple shapes, clean edges, high readability.
- Background: plain (ideally solid light background), no text, no watermark, no logo marks.
- Composition: centered icon with generous padding/margins.
- Color: harmonize with the theme color {{ theme_color }} (use it as the main accent).
- Subject: abstract but relevant to academic research (e.g., lightbulb, atom, graph, microscope, network, chip, neural network, paper, etc.).

Return ONLY the generation prompt text (no JSON, no extra commentary).
